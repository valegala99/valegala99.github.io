      <!-- YOUR TEXT, UNCHANGED -->
      <pre class="text-pre">Sonadec music is a potential subgenre of soundscape composition that emerged as a consequence of the pervasive integration of digital technologies and electronic devices into everyday life. The difficulty in classifying this approach, which I rationalized during my artistic practice from 2022 to 2024, led me to review the existing literature of electroacoustic music and to notice that this type of music is insufficiently contextualized. Moreover, although there are some microgenres related to sonadec music, such as ambient soundscape, there seems to be very few compositions created in this manner despite the large number of active composers. This text aims then to describe sonadec music in its essential traits and to function as a foundational document. For a deeper understanding of the topic it is recommended to consult the paper Sonadec – Between Soundscape Composition, Electronica and The Digital Sublime. The glossary at the end of the paper clarifies the terms used.   

In simple words, sonadec music is the creation of places and events by combining environmental recordings with synthesized electronic sounds that evoke the presence of numerous electronic devices in the environment. These technological objects are approached as a way to reinvest technologization with an aesthetic value and so they must possess vitality and exert a strong influence over their environment.   


CONCEPT 

During 2022, my artistic practice was influenced by the tech industry narratives predicting that immersive virtual reality would soon become omnipresent in daily life. My goal became creating a new type of music that should embody the concept of virtual reality: through sounds, I aimed to create virtual and ideal technological environments. This effort culminated in the publication of the album encoded invitation, which can be considered as a first, preliminary experiment of sonadec music.   

The features of sonadec music have been shaped by the current condition of real-world soundscapes. Specifically by we-ness, the replacement of technologically mediated forms of experience with direct experience (Bull 2007: 17), which increases the presence of schizophonic sounds in real-world soundscapes and facilitates the experience of a real-world soundscape as a schizophonic sound. Therefore, we are daily exposed to a hyperreal or even a simulated soundscape, which contains elements coming from other contexts and spaces, introduced in the environment through electroacoustic reproduction. Digitally copied sounds are clones, identical copies that render meaningless the question of originality. A smartphone ringtone can be heard in dozens of cities at once. The ubiquity of duplicated, transplanted sounds has shattered the illusion of unique, authentic places, which are defined by a collage of sounds from everywhere. As a result, sonadec is not intended to represent actual places and events, but rather to simulate archetypal ones. Sonadec’s context is not simply what is around the listeners, but how the digital culture simulates that archetypal context. It seems affected by Baudrillard’s ecstasy of communication: “the subject is in close proximity to instantaneous images and information”, becoming “merely an entity influenced by media, technological experience, and the hyperreal” (Kellner 2005).   

In sonadec music, electronic sounds are considered the symbol of a virtual technocentric reality. My idea was to use these sounds to recall the presence of electronic devices within sonadec’s imaginary soundscapes, and to give these technological objects a significant role in the process of placemaking. However, in common real environments of the 2020s electronic devices are indeed omnipresent, though they are limited in number and designed for technological convergence. Most of them are not particularly sonically active and, in my opinion, are devoid of fascination.  

Conversely, during the 1990s and the 2000s, there was a proliferation of stand-alone devices with distinct and specific functions, including iPod for music, phone for communication, camera for photography, and various consoles such as Playstation for video gaming, among others. I interpret this variety as a symptom of quality, as well as a way of creating a virtually more varied and enriched soundscape. Sonadec’s environments are then designed by adding more and different electronic devices despite the technological convergence of 2020s common environments, resulting in an attempt to reinvest technologization with an aesthetic value. A recurrent aim, inspired by Jane Bennett’s vital materialism (2010), is to give these imaginary devices a sense of agency and vitality.   

In extending this approach, the design of these virtual sonic environments also echoes larger cultural imaginaries that emerged with the digital revolution. Therefore, sonadec’s contexts are not created in a realistic way, but are instead shaped as interpretations of the Digital Sublime. This term refers to the mythologization of the digital revolution that began in the 1990s, which fostered an idealized version of a digitally enhanced future, where emerging technologies are seamlessly integrated into everyday life, strengthening human connections and serving as expressions of individuality (Mosco 2004). In essence, sonadec is about creating a sonic image (Young 2006) that aligns with how people imagined the world would become during the digital revolution.   

Due to the growing corporate interest in mythology and the utilization of myths for product marketing (Mosco 2004: 32), it is unsurprising that I found traces of the Digital Sublime in the consumer aesthetics Y2K futurism and its evolution, Frutiger Aero. When associated with technology, the Y2K futurism aesthetic depicted a hyper-modern, abstract and idealized future, featuring human figures immersed in digitalized environments and graphics referencing cyberspace and virtual worlds. Conversely, Frutiger Aero reinforced the idea of technology as lifestyle rather than science fiction, juxtaposing technological visuals with natural elements and associating technological advancement with harmony between nature and the environment. I simulated the emergence of Immersive Virtual Reality through the perspective of the Digital Sublime perhaps due to nostalgia cycles or because, as Mosco (2004: 19) suggests, technological myths proliferate during the advent and the early stage of a technology and then dissipate as the new technology becomes fully established. This retrospective component somehow relates sonadec to genres such as hauntology, hypnagogic pop, chillwave and vaporwave, as these types of music aim to simulate auditory experience of the real or imagined recent past. However, sonadec retrospectively simulates how the future was depicted during the 90s and the early 00s with a different musical language.   

The imaginary of sonadec music includes scenarios that are set within an imagined metropolis akin to those described in early cyberculture scholarship such as City of Bits: Space, Place and the Infobahn (Mitchell 1996). The fictional city is further characterized by a multitude of diverse soundscapes and even natural settings, thanks to the rich offering of urban entertainment and due to the condition of hyperreality. The reasoning behind the invention of the term sonadec thus becomes clear: the name is designed to evoke associations with prominent electronics and digital media brands such as Sony, Nintendo, and Panasonic, and is intended to represent a company specialized in the sound design of electronic devices and, more broadly, in crafting soundscapes for virtual experiences.     


SONIC MATERIAL, LANGUAGE 

Environmental sounds form the backbone of a sonadec composition, due to the human tendency to perceive and categorize these sounds as “meaningful events providing relevant information about the environment” (Guastavino 2007: 54), something that can be further explained by Dennis Smalley’s notion of source bonding (1997: 110). These sounds represent the formal element that allows sonadec music to be associated with soundscape composition. However, in sonadec music the sound of a river is not intended as the sound of that particular river, with its own features and contexts, but of an archetypal one, and it may be actually coming from a loudspeaker within an urban soundscape. The recordings are completely detached from their original sources and definitely cease to refer to their local origins. For these reasons, they are approached as sounds capable of evoking generic “global” contexts rather than a single, specific place, reflecting the post-global nature of our societies (Chattopadhyay 2012: 228). 

The electronic sounds used in sonadec music are the ones that resemble the auditory display of real electronic devices and should be implemented in the virtual environment as if they are generated by those technological objects. This is also possible thanks to source bonding and various audio techniques, and this approach qualifies sonadec music as a subgenre of soundscape composition rather than “electronica with environmental recordings.” Most of the used electronic sounds can in fact be associated also with the electronica genre, and especially some of its subgenres such as microsound, noise music, clicks and cuts, but also circuit bending and 8-bit music. In fact, I find it challenging to dissociate Ryoji Ikeda’s tones, for instance, from earcons such as generic electronic device beeps. I believe that certain electronic sounds evoke a generic electronic source: since glitches originate from electronic devices, how could they not be associated with an electronic source? This becomes more evident when considering circuit bending, where these errors are physically generated by hacked electronic devices, and obvious when dealing with tonal sounds that are both auditory displays of real technologies and elements of electronica. In fact, these tonal timbres are the ones that are commonly used for the sonification of real electronic devices such as videogame consoles, computers, cameras and various gadgets, as well as many videogame soundtracks. The question may eventually revolve around the specific source to associate with these sounds, as many devices share similar earcons. Due to this “generic” nature of auditory displays, sonadec’s electronic devices are sometimes real and other times invented in a plausible manner, and any electronic device can be a subject of sonadec music.   

The “electronica/device electronic” sounds can be developed in various ways such as through an abstracted syntax (Emmerson 1986), an imitation of the “native behaviors” of the referenced electronic devices or of their sonic behaviors when used as a medium, by creating a sound collage, or by referencing aural elements of the digital culture. It is important to give to electronic devices a sense of agency and vitality, a sensation that can be induced by providing musicality to the development of their sounds. Much like designers of electronic products do with their creations, a focus should be given to providing sonic interest and aesthetic value to the auditory display of these devices (Dunne 2008).   

Since sonadec music seeks to creatively explore the presence of schizophonic sounds in real-world sonic environments, an optional but intriguing compositional choice can be to include melodic material within the composition as part of the environment. This is because we-ness is also a crucial agent for the presence of electroacoustically reproduced music within the real-world soundscape. This gives rise to the phenomenon that Truax defines music as environment (Truax 2015: 108), which involves perceiving and understanding music as part of the auditory landscape that surrounds and affects us in everyday life. In sonadec, music can be integrated as part of the environment, and the whole environment is listened to as music. From this perspective, sonadec can be a combination of ambient music (music as environment) and soundscape composition (environment as music) approaches.   

It is essential that sonadec’s electronic sounds recall in some way technological objects or the digital culture. The challenge of imitating tonal sounds of electronic devices lies in their ability to reproduce virtually any sounds with the highest quality, which can result in a lack of sonic identity. In fact, many earcons and auditory icons are digitalized acoustic sounds, such as ringtones and notification alarms on modern smartphones, but at least they are reproduced through lo-fi speakers, which affect their timbre. If the intention is to use sounds of acoustic instruments – which are also employed in electronica, as in the works of Austrian producer and guitarist Christian Fennesz – it is necessary to manipulate them to make them associable with electronic devices or equipment. This can be achieved through techniques such as speaker convolution, the introduction of digital artifacts like downsampling, and various distortions or quality reductions.   

When dealing with elements of the digital culture, it is advisable to not excessively incorporate languages that could resemble established music styles in order to avoid stylistic contamination. This is significant because some electronic devices can also virtually reproduce any type of music. It is a likely occurrence for melodic material to impact stylistic integrity, a fact that can be experienced by considering James Ferraro’s Far Side Virtual album, a work that defined the stylistic features of the Vaporwave genre. By looking at Ferraro’s album description, a strong similarity with sonadec music can be found, but the formal difference between the two lies in the fact that Vaporwave incorporates a consistent amount of melodic material, which becomes the central element of the music. This material is related to subgenres of popular music, making Vaporwave itself a microgenre within the broader tradition. I would suggest avoiding clear associations with other established music genres without a valid reason, but I cannot identify sonadec’s rules on pitch and chord usage. One extreme case would be representing an acoustic performance by a musician in the sonic environment. Too much focus on this could cause the composition to be perceived as a different genre that blends environmental recordings and acoustic music. By contrast, sonadec’s focus must remain on the perception of the environment. This aspect is fundamental: even when the context consists in an event, the presence of a surrounding environment must always be evoked. A sonadec composition should enable listeners to perceive themselves as being within a place.   

Another form of we-ness, the use of portable listening devices, has enabled users to replace their surrounding soundscapes with personalized, fully simulated sonic environments, a sort of “soundtrack” (Bull 2007:18-19). It appears that portable listening, especially in noisy sonic environments, can induce a collapse of the distinctions between music and soundscape. Moreover, the possibility to customize the user’s sound world in a portable manner, such as through the use of devices like the iPod, creates a nondiegetic layer within the actual soundscape. In fact, as schizophonic sounds directly enter our ears, we do not perceive a source within the environment, even if there is technically one, as source bonding would naturally lead us to do. The music played by earphones is clearly external from what surrounds us. The ability to personalize one’s sonic environment through portable listening, as well as the fact that music can be perceived as part of the environment, even on a nondiegetic layer, justifies the creation of a soundtrack within a sonadec’s soundscape. Specifically, a “soundtrack” refers to melodic material on a nondiegetic level that is perceived as a carrier of abstract meanings. A sonadec soundtrack should evoke a mood that is, in a sense, imposed on the surrounding environment, much like how iPod users experience their soundtracks (Bull 2007: 60-61). Ideally, while the tonal/melodic material from electronic devices is used to evoke its source, a sonadec soundtrack should do what Truax describes as invoking the psychological context of the represented soundscape (Truax 1996: 63).   

It is not essential for a sonadec composition to include a soundtrack and even address the nondiegetic layer. Moreover, the nondiegetic layer can be filled with other elements than the soundtrack, such as voices, which would function as external narrators of the scene. In fact, a sonadec piece might include speaking behaviors into contexts that are somehow related to them in order to use voices as sources to evoke those contexts.     


METHODOLOGY, TECHNIQUES   

As sonadec contexts are shaped by the vast nexus of simulacra[1] that coordinates 21st-century post-global society, sonadec primarily consists in composing with sounds, which means that elements are selected and organized by the composer to achieve the intended goals. The idea behind the piece shapes the macro aspects of the composition, not the material itself. Sonadec’s methodology does then involve field recording, but it is done in different places to obtain a previously planned result, or at least defined in its generic features. Recordings are also chosen due to their aesthetic properties. The foley sound design approach of layering different sounds to obtain a new, realistic one is a constant choice throughout the process of a sonadec composition (for example, a car crash made by layering smashing and breaking objects). When the composer aims to use sounds that are very difficult to obtain, such as howling wolves, legal sampling and/or the use of sound libraries are viable options. Furthermore, creative sampling is a highly appreciable choice. Regarding electronic sounds, various types of synthesis that employ fixed waveforms can be used, along with the renowned choice of using granular synthesis to manipulate environmental recordings, which is typical of traditional soundscape composition.   

Various methods can be used to construct sonadec’s archetypal contexts. One could be the prototype theory by Eleanor Rosch (1975), which suggests that membership in a conceptual category exists on a graded scale, with some elements being more central than others. Another, less academic approach involves internet aesthetics or how the internet categorizes them, which are labels that groups elements related to central topics.   

An interesting way to integrate melodic materials, outlined during the creation of encoded invitation, consists in creating a musical layer containing a culturally codified solution: a kind of contextual musical identity that relates to the context represented in the composition. However, this approach might not be doable since not all the contexts have such musical identity (what music should represent a marketplace?) or the musical identity might be unrepresentable as it would lead to stylistic contamination (for instance, music typically associated with a piano bar in a cocktail lounge – a deeply ingrained cultural connection between a particular musical style and physical location).   

A strategy to reinforce the perception of realistic electronic sources within the environment could be to layer recordings of tactile interactions with actual devices or objects. Furthermore, the use of convolution facilitates the achievement of a realistic integration within the sonic environment, which is able to provide a sense of objecthood to these sounds.     


CONCLUSIONS, FUTURE IMPLICATIONS   

Here is the exhaustive definition of sonadec music: it is a context-based composition made by environmental sounds and electronic synthesized sounds taken from actual soundscapes and electronica. The electronic sounds are implemented in a way to emphasize the presence of electronic devices, providing them a sort of agency and vitality. A melodic material may also be included as part of the environment, or as a “soundtrack”, to represent the chosen context. Even when the context of a composition in centered on an event, the presence of a surrounding environment is always evoked: a sonadec composition immerses the listener in a sense of place. Finally, the created contexts are interpretations of the Digital Sublime. Through the interplay and alternation of these elements, a sonadec composition emerges.   

I am genuinely optimistic about sonadec music’s potential and I believe it is capable of embodying the sound of the current hyperreality we experience daily. Furthermore, sonadec music is an opportunity to converge academic and nonacademic electronic music, as it is a paradigm that blends soundscape composition with elements of electronica. Thus, it could foster a level of inclusivity that is often perceived as merely mythical (Hugill 2016: 6), and it may even bridge the gap identified by Leigh Landy about the limited amount of audience interested in electroacoustic music (2007). Sonadec ideas can go beyond the medium of fixed-media composition and can be adapted to virtual reality experiences, audiovisual installations, videogames, movies and live electronics – applications that will be further explored in the future. A more ambitious and compelling goal would be the following: can sonadec inspire a rethinking of the technologies that surround us from an auditory perspective? Can sonadec’s simulated contexts inspire technologists to reshape the technological environment with an auditory aesthetic enhancement?     


ESSENTIAL RULES OF SONADEC MUSIC   

-Sonadec must include environmental recordings with an acoustic character and synthesized electronic sounds. The electronic sounds should be used to recall the presence of electronic devices in the environment, which is a central element of the piece. A context that lacks electronic devices cannot be the subject of a sonadec composition.   

-The creation of a place should be perceivable in a sonadec composition. Its nature should be as clear as possible as well as the one of the overall context. Every element is influenced by the context of the composition.   

-Sonadec can include melodic material, both diegetically and nondiegetically, but its use shouldn’t become the central element. In fact, excessive emphasis on melody could alter its perception, aligning it too closely with other genres. This material shouldn’t recall musical languages related to affirmed music genres unless there are particular cases, as stylistic contamination should be avoided. If acoustic tonal sounds are intended to be used, they should be manipulated in order to recall an electronic nonmusical source or a connection with the digital culture.   

-Sylistic contamination should be avoided at any level unless there are specific reasons.   

-Any electronic device can be the subject of sonadec, even invented ones, but they must be crafted in a plausible manner by using sonic imagination.   

-Sonadec can be referred to any manifestations of the Digital Sublime.   

-The use of voice is doable but optional.

Context-based composition= Music which represents a context that inform the design, material and organization of a work (Hill 2017: 11).   

Diegetic and nondiegetic= Sounds with a physical source, even electroacoustic, in the environment (Chion 1994). Sound whose supposed source is not only absent from the image but also external to the story world (1994: 74)   

Earcon= Nonverbal audio cues used in user-computer interfaces to convey information about various computer objects, operations, or interactions (Blattner, Sumikawa, Greenberg 1989: 13).   

Electronica= Electronic music that flourishes primarily outside of academia but also claims some independence from the mainstream music industry. Electronica is split between dance genres such as house or techno and non-dance-oriented music such as drone, ambient, or glitch. (Demers 2010: 167).   

Environmental sounds= Sounds that are found in real environments   

Microsound= A subgenre of electronica and a form of electronic music that emerged in the mid-1990s outside of academic institutions, distinct from the academic microsound pioneered by Curtis Roads (Demers 2010: 71-72). Artists such as Ryoji Ikeda, Alva Noto, and Aoki Takamasa utilize software applications to investigate the “micro” aspects of sounds, resulting in genres like glitch music and clicks and cuts, which employ glitches and digital “mistakes” occurring from the mistranslation or deterioration of digital data, as well as other errors in electronic digital technologies (169). Over time, artists have come to aesthetically value these mistakes rather than avoid them (Cascone 2000).   

Schizophonia= The separation of a sound from its source through electroacoustic reproduction (Truax 1999).   

Sonic environment= Synonym of soundscape (Truax 1999).   

Soundscape= An environment of sound that can refer to both actual environments and abstract constructions such as musical compositions (Truax 1999).   

Soundscape composition= A form of electroacoustic music, developed at Simon Fraser University and elsewhere, characterized by the presence of recognizable environmental sounds and contexts, the purpose being to invoke the listener’s associations, memories, and imagination related to the soundscape (Truax 2000).   

Source bonding= The natural tendency to relate sounds to supposed sources and causes, and to relate sounds to each other because they appear to have shared or associated origins. (Smalley 1997: 110).   

We-ness= a concept derived by Michael Bull from Adorno’s work, which refers to “the substitution of technologically mediated forms of experience for direct experience.” (2007: 17).
